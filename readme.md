# Basic chatbot using BlenderBot 2.0 and Flask

Note: this is separate to my NEA

## Requirements

* Windows (this program is currently untested on other operating systems)
* Python version 3.9.9 (untested on other versions) (download from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-399/ "Download the Windows installer (64-bit)"))
* Command-line access
* Up-to-date web browser such as Google Chrome or Firefox
* Whilst there are no designated system requirements, the program will work faster and perform better with higher clock speed CPUs

## Features

* An AI capable of holding a conversation on a broad range of general topics
* A search feature, allowing users to search for a previous message and find the context surrounding it ![Example search results](other/search_example.png)
* A reporting feature, allowing users to report select messages along with a reason as to why, which will then be logged in a separate file ![Example of the report form](other/report_example.png)
* A separate light and dark mode ![A comparison of the light mode and dark mode](other/theme_comparison.png)
* AI changes complexity depending on the performance of the system
* Basic grammar checker on user and AI messages

## Limitations

* The AI does not take into account any context, only using the submitted message
